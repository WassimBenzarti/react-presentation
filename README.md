# Let's create a simple component
Before that, let's write the HTML of our component in a separate file

<my-code data-name="App.js">

```html
<div>
	<img src="assets/2020-12-24-13-02-59.png" />
	<h3>Barcelo</h3>
	<p>Morocco</p>
</div>
```

</my-code>

---

# Let's create a simple component
Now we create a function that returns that HTML. BOOM we created a component.

<my-code data-name="App.js">

```javascript
export default function 
<div>
	<img src="assets/2020-12-24-13-02-59.png" />
</div>
```

</my-code>
